# Solar-Radiation-Analysis-Project-Documentation
1. Introduction

Solar radiation is the energy emitted by the sun and received by the Earth in the form of electromagnetic waves. Understanding solar radiation levels is essential for applications such as solar power generation, weather forecasting, agriculture, climate studies, and environmental monitoring.

This project focuses on analyzing solar radiation data to understand daily, monthly, and seasonal variations, and to build insights that can help in solar panel installation, energy prediction, and environmental research.

2. Objective

The major objectives of this project are:

To collect and process solar radiation data from reliable sources.

To visualize solar radiation patterns using graphs and charts.

To identify peak solar hours and seasonal trends.

To perform analytics that support solar energy planning.

3. Features of the Project

Data cleaning and preprocessing of solar radiation datasets.

Calculation of:

Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)

Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)

Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)

Visualization of radiation levels over time.

Trend analysis and comparison between datasets.

Supports CSV/Excel datasets.

4. Tools & Technologies Used
